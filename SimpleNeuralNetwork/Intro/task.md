### Two-Layer Fully Connected Neural Network using Numpy

In this assignment, you are required to implement a simple 
fully connected neural network "from scratch", 
meaning only using Numpy. 
You need to implement the forward pass and backpropagation with weight updates.

Ideally, you should accomplish this without additional loops, 
and you must ensure convergence on the binary classification task 
of the four vertices of a two-dimensional square.

In this task just look at the base class in the file `main.py` carefully.
