In this task you will implement the forward pass of a simple neural network. 
The network has 2 input nodes, 2 hidden nodes and 1 output node. 
The activation function of the hidden nodes and output node is the sigmoid function.

### Task
1. Implement the sigmoid function
2. Implement the forward pass of the neural network, using matrix multiplication `np.dot`
